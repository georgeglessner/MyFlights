# My Flights

This repo hosts all of the flights my PiAware setup has tracked, which is aggregated by [FlightLogger](https://github.com/georgeglessner/FlightLogger). 

This repo is updated every 12 hours via cron and bash.

## Graphing Data

I have create a simple bar chart plotting script to plot the data stored in this repo. If you would like to use it for your data, you can find the script [here](https://github.com/georgeglessner/FlightPlotter).
